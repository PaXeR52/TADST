Tophes Arma Dedicated Server Tool (TADST) v3.1.0
by Tophe of Östgöta Ops
==================================================================

The Armed Assault series allows an amazing array of settings to freely customize dedicated servers. 
This means you will have to edit quite a few config files to get it running the way you like.

TADST is a tool that will greatly simplify this. All you need to do is to choose the settings 
you like. Then the application will create all necessary files according to your settings and 
start the server with the appropriate arguments.

All necessary files will be created in a folder called 'TADST'.
You can save different profiles to easily switch between server setups.

In the folder TADST a new folder for each profile will be created. 
This folder contains all files associated to the profile. 

For support, suggestions, bug reports etc.please use the thread at BIS forum:

INSTALLATION
=============
Copy the file 'TADST.exe' to your ArmA game folder. 

* Note that it's important that the file is in the game root folder
  i.e. C:\Games\Steam\SteamApps\common\Arma 3

* If you are upgrading from an earlier version of TADST you should delete 
  your old TADST folder so the program can create new settings files.

You also need to have .NET installed.




FUTURE PLANS AND IDEAS
======================
The TADST is a work in progress. 
Plans and dreams for upcoming releases:

*  Options for allowedFileExtensions, allowedPreprocessFileExtensions, allowedHTMLLoadExtensions, allowedHTMLLoadURIs
*  Options to automatically launch headless clients
*  Steam server update thingy
*  System for setting Mission Parameters.
*  Start as service.
*  Process monitoring, restart server on crash.
*  Remote server/client protocol (probably wont't happen, but hey)
